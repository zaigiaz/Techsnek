# OVERVIEW

This will be the snake game that is usually played
on google.com but written in Python with some more
arcade elements and more features, that I will explore
and see what is interesting to do.

# Gameplay ideas

- Portals
- Spawn Walls
- Different Fruits
- Changing Levels with different challenges
- daily challenges that are randomized
- Score, Score-attack system, etc.
- powerups and specific levels
- enemy AI, etc.
